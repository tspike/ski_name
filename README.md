This is a dorky little application that takes your initials as input and outputs a "ski bum" name. I am well aware that Rails, especially with all of the gems I use, is complete overkill for this project. I used this as a way to learn TDD, and built this from nothing almost never opening my browser. It was inspired by a really crappy post that got popular on /r/skiing, which took a blues name generator and slapped the words "ski bum" on it.
